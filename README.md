# Full Stack Application Using Next.js 13, React, TailwindCSS, Prisma, MongoDB, and NextAuth

[Project available here](https://library.vercel.app/)

This is the first Next.js project I made. I mostly wanted to implement the knowledge I gained from tutorials, but also wanted to provide a little value to people who want to share information. It can also be used for birthday surprises.

Lessons I learned:

- Don’t come up with too many features, they will be constant distractions as you try to implement the core features of your project
- Use a component library, it will save you so much time
- Search things up a lot so you won’t be stuck with your current methodology, because you never know when there could be a better solution

Features of this website:

- Styled with TailwindCSS
- User authentication handled by NextAuth
- Image upload using Cloudinary
- Create and delete items with Next.js app router API and Prisma
- Password protected items
- Some data fetching done by a Python backend server
- Client form validation and handling via react-hook-form
- Search bar for items
- Hosting websites (from a few specific domains, but more can be added)
- CUID creation and validation
